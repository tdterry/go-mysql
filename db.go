	Database systems are pieces of software (usually outside of Go)
	that allow storage and retrieval of data. Note that we try not
	to imply "relational" at the level of this API.

	Database interfaces are pieces of software (usually written in
	Go) that allow Go programs to interact with database systems
	through some query language. Note that we try not to imply "SQL"
	at the level of this API.

	Each database interface must provide a Version() function to
	allow careful clients to configure themselves appropriately
	for the database system in question. There are a number of
	well-known keys in the map returned by Version():

	Key		Description

	version		generic version
	client		client version
	server		server version
	protocol	protocol version
	interface	database interface version

	The specific database interface can decide which of these
	keys to return. For example, sqlite3 returns "version" and
	"interface"; mysql should probably return all keys except
	"version" instead.

	Database interfaces can also return additional keys, provided
	they prefix them appropriately. The sqlite3 interface, for
	example, returns "sqlite3.sourceid" as well.

/*
	Each database interface must provide an Open() function to
	establish connections to a database system. Database systems
	require a wide variety of parameters for connections, which
	is why the parameters to Open() are passed as a map.

	TODO: use map[string]string instead? may be friendlier if we
	are sure we never need to pass anything complicated; or pass
	a URI instead?

	Each map entry consists of a string key and a generic value.
	There are a number of well-known keys that apply to many (if
	not all) database systems:

	Name		Type	Description

	name		string	the database to connect to
	host		string	the host to connect to
	port		int	the port to connect to
	username	string	the user to connect as
	password	string	the password for that user

	For example, the following piece of code tries to connect to
	a MySQL database on the local machine at the default port:

	c, e := mysql.Open(Arguments{
		"name": "mydb",
		"username": "phf",
		"password": "somepassword"}
	)

	Note that defaults for all keys are specific to the database
	interface in question and should be documented there.

	The Open() function is free to ignore entries that it has no
	use for. For example, the sqlite3 interface only understands
	"name" and ignores the other well-known keys.

	A database interface is free to introduce additional keys if
	necessary, however those keys have to start with the package
	name of the database interface in question. For example, the
	sqlite3 interface supports the key "sqlite3.vfs".
